    2300. Successful Pairs of Spells and Potions

    You are given two positive integer arrays spells and potions, of length n and m respectively, where spells[i] represents the strength of the ith spell and potions[j] represents the strength of the jth potion.

    You are also given an integer success. A spell and potion pair is considered successful if the product of their strengths is at least success.

    Return an integer array pairs of length n where pairs[i] is the number of potions that will form a successful pair with the ith spell.

    Example 1:

    Input: spells = [5,1,3], potions = [1,2,3,4,5], success = 7
    Output: [4,0,3]
    Explanation:
    - 0th spell: 5 * [1,2,3,4,5] = [5,10,15,20,25]. 4 pairs are successful.
    - 1st spell: 1 * [1,2,3,4,5] = [1,2,3,4,5]. 0 pairs are successful.
    - 2nd spell: 3 * [1,2,3,4,5] = [3,6,9,12,15]. 3 pairs are successful.
    Thus, [4,0,3] is returned.
    Example 2:

    Input: spells = [3,1,2], potions = [8,5,8], success = 16
    Output: [2,0,2]
    Explanation:
    - 0th spell: 3 * [8,5,8] = [24,15,24]. 2 pairs are successful.
    - 1st spell: 1 * [8,5,8] = [8,5,8]. 0 pairs are successful. 
    - 2nd spell: 2 * [8,5,8] = [16,10,16]. 2 pairs are successful. 
    Thus, [2,0,2] is returned.
    

    Constraints:

    n == spells.length
    m == potions.length
    1 <= n, m <= 10^5
    1 <= spells[i], potions[i] <= 10^5
    1 <= success <= 10^10

    3494. Find the Minimum Amount of Time to Brew Potions
 
    You are given two integer arrays, skill and mana, of length n and m, respectively.

    In a laboratory, n wizards must brew m potions in order. Each potion has a mana capacity mana[j] and must pass through all the wizards sequentially to be brewed properly. The time taken by the ith wizard on the jth potion is timeij = skill[i] * mana[j].

    Since the brewing process is delicate, a potion must be passed to the next wizard immediately after the current wizard completes their work. This means the timing must be synchronized so that each wizard begins working on a potion exactly when it arrives. â€‹

    Return the minimum amount of time required for the potions to be brewed properly.

    Example 1:

    Input: skill = [1,5,2,4], mana = [5,1,4,2]

    Output: 110

    Explanation:

    Potion Number	Start time	Wizard 0 done by	Wizard 1 done by	Wizard 2 done by	Wizard 3 done by
    0	0	5	30	40	60
    1	52	53	58	60	64
    2	54	58	78	86	102
    3	86	88	98	102	110
    As an example for why wizard 0 cannot start working on the 1st potion before time t = 52, consider the case where the wizards started preparing the 1st potion at time t = 50. At time t = 58, wizard 2 is done with the 1st potion, but wizard 3 will still be working on the 0th potion till time t = 60.

    Constraints:

    n == skill.length
    m == mana.length
    1 <= n, m <= 5000
    1 <= mana[i], skill[i] <= 5000
